# Weather Totems

Weather Totems is a mod for [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) that adds an additional four totems to change the weather. Now you can also change the weather to be sunny, windy, snowy or stormy instead of just rainy. Each totem also has different activation animations.

This will of course have some interesting effects. You can make it snow in summer if you want to!

A few notes:
- The wind and snow totem will not work on Ginger Island.
- If a wind totem is used in summer or winter, the forecast will say it will snow. The weather will actually be windy so you can ignore this.
- The mod may conflict with mods that edit the last four spots of the Maps/springobjects asset, this is where the mod injects the totem sprites.

### Installation:
This is a mod I made for my personal use, as a result, it won't be officially released. This is due to the likely incompatibility issues with JA mods. Maybe after 1.6 I will release it properly.
If you want to use the mod you'll need to download the source code and compile it yourself as well as have SMAPI installed. Nevertheless, I'll leave the mod open source as a reference for other modders, feel free to fork this repository.
